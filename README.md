The MedOps Trial Management system is aimed towards researchers
who want to gather data for conducting research and/or helping test the
effectiveness of a new medical device to assist in its approval process.
The system will extend its coverage with the help of mobile computing
so that researchers or doctors can operate the trial in various locations
in the world, including remote countries where medical facilities are not
present or easily accessible. Researchers use the trial management
system to conduct different trials for the purpose of gathering research
data and using the data to help test the effective of a medical device
which may be seeking approval. The system helps the researcher
prepare for a trial by selecting candidate that can help contribute the
most towards the research of the trial. Researchers are able to view the
data from past trials to assist in their research, such as looking for trends
or similarities between the data obtained through the trial. Using
cognitive computing, researchers can select the best-fit candidates to
participate in the trial using attributed information for the patient. With
the help of data analytics, researchers are also able to run
experimentations on patients for research purposes.
